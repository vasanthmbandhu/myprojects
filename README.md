assembly_line_correlation:
Found the correlation coefficient between the percentage availability of an assembly line and readings from sensors of six different types (current, voltage and so forth) using Random Forest algorithm. Helped create a digital twin of the assembly line.

mnist: 
Trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset to generate images of handwritten digits.

Gan_Keysight:
Trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network on suitably encoded HTTP Get Request Packet Data to generate pseudo real HTTP network packets.

robust_random_cut_forest:
Used the robust random cut package (https://github.com/kLabUM/rrcf) to detect anomalies in streaming (time-series) data.
